## Hi there 👋

I am a Doctoral reaserch student in the [Cellular Engineering group](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-bioproducts-and-biosystems/cellular-engineering) at Aalto University.
This is more of personal page, since most of the things here are not directly related to my research and are more so of a hoddy/fun/usefull things that I try to do in my free time. 😊
